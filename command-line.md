The questions proposed are answered with two types of answers. System 1 answers are what automatically flew into my head and System 2 answers are more thought out perhaps pertains to the question. :)

1. Without using jargon, how would you describe a command-line to a lay person? (e.g, your mom)

    System 1 Answer: I wouldn't, I would show her all the cool things she could do, like telling the computer to say something to another user.
            For example: She could type in her terminal: $ say "Honey, don't forget to take out the trash tommorrow" (I would have to enable remote loggin or remote apple events of course as well as being on same network, etc.)

    System 2 Answer: "It's like when you leave to work and leave post it notes on the fridge with a to do list". You write it down because it's faster then telling me because you're going to be late for work. That, in a "nutshell" is what a terminal is. Telling the computer what to do by typing instead of using a mouse. 

2. List 10 Terminal commands in plain english. 
  
    1.  pwd:   Print working directory  // prints the path to the directory, basically the breadcrumb links to where your directory is placed and prints that.
    2.  cd:    Change Directory         // Change folders to another folder. e.g, from folder 1 to folder 2.
    3.  mkdir: Make a new directory     // Basically making a new folder. e.g, right click > new folder > name folder > voila!
    4.  ls:    List files               // prints the files in the working directory in a list format.
    5.  cp:    Copy file/directory      // Copies files or directories to another destination.
    6.  mv:    Move file/directory      // Move files or directories to another destination.
    7.  pushd: Push Directory           // The pusd command saves your current directory into a list then changes to another directory.
    8.  popd:  Pop directory            // The popd command "pops" you back into the directory you just "pushd".
    9.  echo:  write some arguments     // There are loads of ways of using echo to print arguments to the screen. e.g: echo Hollow Earth! > result: Hollow Earth!
    10.  exit:  Close terminal/session   // Exits the current session or terminal. I'ts like pressing the close button.
